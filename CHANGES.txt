0.10.0 (2014-11)
----------------

- Added "evaporation" module, which calculates evaporation, and
  related "vaporize" command line application.
- Added "swb" module, which determines irrigation needs based on soil
  water balance.
- Improvement in API of cliapp.
- timeseries.datetime_from_iso() is now deprecated; use the "iso8601"
  module instead. timeseries.datetime_from_iso() will be removed in
  version 1.0.
- Fordonia, bitia and pond have been renamed to aggregate, spatialize,
  and enhydris_cache.
- Aggregate (formerly fordonia) and spatialize (formerly bitia) now
  store the time zone in their output files (if it has been specified
  in their input).
- Spatialize (formerly bitia) can now use seasonal albedo, and it now
  also recalculates already existing output if in the meantime more
  data has become available.
- Experimental Mac OS X support.

0.9.0 (2014-06-16)
------------------

- New application Pond performs local filesystem caching of Enhydris

  is a number from 0 (for most recent) to files_to_produce.

  must be called before it in order to update the local cache.
