.. class:: TimeseriesCache(timeseries_groups)
  
   Keeps certain time series cached in the filesystem. The time series
   is downloaded from Enhydris using the Enhydris web service API.
   *timeseries_groups* is a list; each item is a dictionary
   representing an Enhydris time series; its keys are *base_url*,
   *user*, *password*, *id*, and *file*; the latter is the filename of
   the file to which the time series will be cached (absolute or
   relative to the current working directory).

   .. method:: update()

      Downloads everything that has not already been downloaded (or all
      the time series if nothing is in the cache).

.. class:: EnhydrisCacheApp

   This class contains the :doc:`../user/enhydris_cache` command-line
   application.  The :file:`enhydris_cache` executable does little
   other than this::

      application = EnhydrisCacheApp()
      application.run()
